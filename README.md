###  •  Example
The sample code :

    verticalSpacing={5} // The space of Items Vertically
    horizontalSpacing={5} // The space of Items Horizontally
    itemsPerRow={2} // Number of Items in each row of the page
    itemsNumber={4} // Number of Items in each page
    withImage // Whether the Item contain Image or not
    data={mockedData} // We Provide Data that contain the title , description and image url of the items
    imageStyle={ // We can choose the rate size of image contained in each Item
        {
        "heightRate": 100,
        "widthRate": 50
        }
    }
    childrenContent={ // Wanna add some button for action or whatever, add it here !
        (item) => {
            <div>
                Whatever you want ;) !
                {item.id} // You'll need the item object for some actions
            </div>

You'll notice that the Example above need to be more stylish !
<br>
Don't worry, you can add a costum css styles in each composant in our set of items.

We can override the style of this properties :
<br>
<ul>
<li>
imageStyle
</li>
<li>
boxStyle
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>

    horizontalSpacing={4}
    ....
    imageStyle={

        "heightRate": 100,
        "widthRate": 50,
        "borderTopLeftRadius": "10px",
        "borderBottomLeftRadius": "10px",
        "boxShadow": "4px 0px 5px 1px gray"
        }
